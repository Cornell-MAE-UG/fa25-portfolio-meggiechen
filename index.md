## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Meggie Chen, and I'm a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. 

Whether I'm designing and manufacturing structural components for unmanned aerial vehicles on Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems, or running CP2K simulations in my research at ASTRALab, I'm passionate about building, experimenting, and problem-solving.I am particularly interested in robotics and aerospace system design for space applications, with a focus on autonomous technologies

Outside of the classroom, you can usually find me trying new coffee shops and restaurants around Ithaca, or curled up on the couch in my quest to finish watching my ever-growing, never ending list of movies and TV shows.
